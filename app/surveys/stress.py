    INTERPRETATION_GUIDE = """
    Interpreting the Single-Item Stress Measure involves understanding the respondent's perceived stress level within the specified timeframeâ€”in this case, weekly.

    Stress Measure Overview:
    Question: "On a scale from 1 to 5, how stressed have you felt this week?"
    Response Scale:
    1: Not at all stressed
    2: Slightly stressed
    3: Moderately stressed
    4: Very stressed
    5: Extremely stressed

    Considerations for Interpretation:
    - Responses are subjective and can be influenced by current mood, recent events, or individual perception of stress.
    - Consider contextual factors such as major life changes, work deadlines, or personal issues.
    - Cultural backgrounds may influence how individuals perceive and report stress.
    - Consider complementing with additional measures for a more comprehensive understanding.
